# JiraWidget

A simple desktop widget for displaying Jira issue counts. Integrates with Jira Server.

![Screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)

The example above shows 2 configured counts but you can configure as many as you'd like.

## Notes / Features

* The counts are refreshed once per minute.
* Clicking on a label/count will open a Jira search (in the default browser) listing the issues.
* The widget will always stay on top of other windows.
* The Jira instance must allow at least anonymous read only access. There is currently no option to configure credentials.
* By default labels with a 0 count will be shown but they can be optionally hidden with `"hideWhenZero": true`.
* As labels are shown/hidden the app will resize. By default this will be anchored to the top left of the app but this can be changed with `anchorBottom` and `anchorRight`.
